        Assignment 3: Rock-Paper-Scissors
        Description: The point is to simulate a game of rock-paper-scissors where a student plays against the computer, and the computer acts as referee.
        VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
           numGames (int) = the nums of rounds the player wants to play
           playerWins (int) = num of games the player won
           computerWins(int) = the num of round the computer won
           ties(int) = the num of round they both won 
           computerRandomChoice (int) = the computers chosing the randam num
           computerChoice (char) =  the final computer choice
